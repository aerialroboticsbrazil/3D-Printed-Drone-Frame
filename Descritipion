COPTER HACK 2021 – 3D printed drone frame
Hello everyone, I hope you are well, my name is Bruno Tomaz, I am Brazilian, I am 18 years old, I am a Mechatronics student at SENAI and I am a World Skills BRASIL competitor in the field of aerial robotics, I am also part of the creator of cultural movements and support DIY initiatives (do it yourself)
I believe that these ideas and initiatives promote the dissemination of knowledge and development for people.
The main mechanical component of a drone is its frame, responsible for containing all other parts, in order to preserve the construction of the integrated and unstable drone protecting its components, in order to enable its operation
Normally all impacts suffered by the drone are absolved by its frame, and this makes it the most prone to breakage, even if these are made of strong materials such as plastic polymers or carbon fiber.
When this component is broken it is very difficult to repair it correctly or to acquire only the part that has broken from it.
which makes it necessary to buy another frame, which costs time and Money
Our project is about designing and testing a clover 4 frame that can be completely printed on 3D printers with FDM or SLA technology.
Creating a fully printed and functional frame option for the clover 4 drone can not only make frame replacement and repair easier and faster, but it can also let pilots know and develop skills with additive manufacturing Technologies
A drone frame produced through this additive manufacturing process has several advantages such as:
• Cheap
• Customizable
• Easy to fix
• Extremely popular tecnology
moreover the idea is that the frame guarantees a good performance in the following aspects:
• Ligth
• Agile
• Fast fly
• few vibrations
Currently the project is in the development and prototyping phase, tools for stress analysis and CAD software topology are being used for the development of the structure.
